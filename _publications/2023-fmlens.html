The fund investment industry heavily depends on the expertise of fund managers who manage portfolios for clients. Their investment knowledge and professional skills provide them a competitive edge in the market, leading investors to prefer investing in fund managers rather than directly in funds. Selecting a suitable fund manager is thus crucial for these investors. While previous studies have explored fund managers using quantitative or qualitative methods, focusing on performance metrics, personal characteristics, and performance persistence, they often struggle with large candidate pools and distinguishing between skill and luck in a manager's performance. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces FMLens, an interactive visual analytics system. FMLens assists investors in efficiently evaluating fund managers' investment styles and capabilities across multiple dimensions. It also allows for inspecting and comparing their performance. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through two case studies and a qualitative user study, with feedback from domain experts confirming FMLens's ability to analyze fund managers from various perspectives and enhance the efficiency of fund manager evaluation and selection.
