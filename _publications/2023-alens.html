In the realm of higher education, the importance of novice researchers mastering the art of abstract writing is well recognized, particularly as they often face hurdles in this endeavor. Traditionally, enrolling in writing training courses has been the recommended path for students to enhance their abstract writing skills. However, this method frequently proves inadequate in offering personalized and flexible feedback on their abstract writing. To bridge this gap, we initiated a formative study to understand the user requirements for an abstract writing training tool. Following this, we introduced ALens, a domain-specific training tool for abstract writing. ALens utilizes rhetorical structure parsing to identify key concepts in abstracts, assesses drafts based on linguistic attributes, and applies visualization techniques to examine the writing patterns in exemplary abstracts. The effectiveness of our approach was validated through a comparative user study with another abstract writing training tool.
