Heterogeneous graphs, containing both semantic and structural information, are increasingly prevalent in real-world data sets. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a favored tool for analyzing these graphs, with a design space that has been thoroughly investigated. However, the methods for exploring the design space of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) often yield less than optimal results, are computationally demanding, and lack explainability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel methodology that not only compares searched models to pinpoint the most effective search directions but also integrates explainability. Furthermore, we have developed a visual analytics system named VAC-HGNN (Visual Analytics for Comparing HGNNs). This system aids HGNN practitioners in understanding and comparing HGNNs at three distinct levels: the graph level, the group level, and the individual level. It features a design space view and a comparison view, both equipped with rich interactive capabilities. The efficiency and user-friendliness of VAC-HGNN are underscored through two case studies and interviews with experts.
