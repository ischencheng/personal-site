This study explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in assisting developers to comprehend code generated at function and class levels. Despite the promising capabilities of LLMs in code generation, challenges such as prompt engineering, model generalization, and understanding complex code structures persist. Through a literature review and semi-structured interviews with 15 developers, we identified six main challenges in leveraging LLMs for code comprehension. To address these, we introduce CodeCognoscenti, a Visual Studio Code extension designed to facilitate efficient interaction with LLMs. It employs automatic iterative prompting, an explanation-sifting mechanism, and specialized LLM agents for abstracting data structures and explaining data transformations. A usability study with 15 developers showed that CodeCognoscenti enhances the comprehension of LLM-generated code, highlighting its potential to improve developers' efficiency and confidence in working with AI-generated code. Our research contributes to the understanding of LLMs in code comprehension and presents a practical tool for developers.
